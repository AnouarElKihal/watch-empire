# WATCH EMPIRE
In this project I created a watch website template using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The template includes an additional gallery page and a watch description page.
To make the website even more engaging, I utilized the swiper-bundle JavaScript and CSS library, which allowed me to create a beautiful and interactive slider for the home page.
